This program demonstrates how to build a simple job control system with vert.x.

This system contains a worker controller verticle, which controls worker verticles.
After the controller is established, it will deploy workers as 'worker verticles' and
send virtual jobs to them. When all jobs dispatched, the controller will monitor the
progress of the last running jobs, and end vertx system properly.
